# 🧠 Learning Dev Web – 12 Week Journey
Welcome!  
This repository tracks my **self-taught journey** to become a web developer in 12 weeks.  
Every day, I learn, build, and publish, one step at a time.

## 📅 Daily Structure (4h per day)
1. **1h – Learning**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, UI/UX, APIs, etc.  
2. **1h – Practice**: Exercises and small challenges  
3. **1h – GitHub Projects**: Code added and pushed to branches  
4. **1h – LinkedIn Post**: Sharing my daily progress

## 🚧 Branches
Each day of learning has its own dedicated branch :
day-01-html-basics
day-02-text-and-images
day-03-forms
You can explore the code of each session directly through the branches.

## 🎯 Final Goal
By the end of this journey, I will have created:
- A modern animated **E-Commerce website**
- A technical documentation site for my **MEDINEX project**
- A complete and responsive **portfolio website**

All built from scratch with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.
